### Sublime Text Color Scheme

This is a dark text on light background theme, with vivid highlights.

This is the theme I use to work on [b2evolution](http://b2evolution.net/).

## Installation

You need to copy the color scheme into the Sublime Text Packages directory. 

1. You can find the path of the directory using the `Preferences -> Browse Packages` menu within Sublime Text.
2. Copy the color scheme into this directory.
3. Use the Color Schemes option of your preferences menu to select the evo color scheme.
